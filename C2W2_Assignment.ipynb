        "Welcome to this assignment! As in the previous week, you will be using the famous `cats vs dogs` dataset to train a model that can classify images of dogs from images of cats. For this, you will create your own Convolutional Neural Network in Tensorflow and leverage Keras' image preprocessing utilities, more so this time around since Keras provides excellent support for augmenting image data.\n",
